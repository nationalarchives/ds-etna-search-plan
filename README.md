## Introduction

This repository sets out iterations of the user flow for the Etna search project, the aims of which are set out in the associated [marketplace opportunity](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/15311)

Each iteration will be versioned and described here with an explanation of **how and why** it differs from its predecessor. PDF and `.xml` versions that can be opened for editing on [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) are linked to below and available in the corresponding folder within this repository (for example, to access the resources for iteration 0.0.0 you would go to the `Iterations/0.0.0/` folder in this repository)

## Iterations

### 0.0.2 Flow sign-off session

On 24/11 a meeting was held to sign off the flow before starting to wireframe. This [version](Iterations/0.0.2) reflects all additions from that session:

* Update flow to acknowledge known problems with word 'Advanced' in search (Jenifer)
* Include arrows between columns (Matt H) 
* Provide tips to reduce the number of results (Matt H - as part of results page) - and with ability to hide them - and for the choice to be persisted
* Add record custodian (Matt H)

### 0.0.1 Project outset (additional suggestions)

This [version](Iterations/0.0.1) adds the following suggestions to the results page: 

* Clear all filters (Ruth)
* Inclusion of record creators on the results page (Simon)
* Download/export results (Simon)

The inclusion of record creators as a search option also means we'll need to have a details page for record creators, so this has been added too.

### 0.0.0 Project outset

This [version](Iterations/0.0.0/) shows high-level assumptions about the scope of this phase of work and a **very** high level representation of a user flow.
