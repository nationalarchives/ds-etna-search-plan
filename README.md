## Introduction

This repository sets out iterations of the user for the Etna search project, the aims of which are set out in the associated [marketplace opportunity](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/15311)

Each iteration will be versioned and described here with an explanation of **how and why** it differs from its predecessor. PDF and `.xml` versions that can be opened for editing on [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) are linked to below and available in the corresponding folder within this repository (for example, to access the resources for iteration 0.0.0 you would go to the `Iterations/0.0.0/` folder in this repository)
